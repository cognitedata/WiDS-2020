    "## Accessing Cognite Data Platform (CDP)\n",
    "* The CDP organizes digital information about the physical world.\n",
    "* There are 6 kinds of objects stored on the CDP. Each of these objects in the CDP are labelled with a unique ID. Information regarding a specific Asset, Event, etc are often retrieved using this ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [Assets](https://doc.cognitedata.com/api/0.5/#tag/Assets) are digital representations of physical objects or groups of objects, and assets are organized into an asset hierarchy. For example, an asset can represent a water pump which is part of a subsystem on an oil platform.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * [Event](https://doc.cognitedata.com/api/0.5/#tag/Events) objects store complex information about multiple assets over a time period. For example, an event can describe two hours of maintenance on a water pump and some associated pipes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * A [File](https://doc.cognitedata.com/api/0.5/#tag/Files) stores a sequence of bytes connected to one or more assets. For example, a file can contain a piping and instrumentation diagram (P&IDs) showing how multiple assets are connected.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * A [Time Series](https://doc.cognitedata.com/api/0.5/#tag/Time-series) consists of a sequence of data points connected to a single asset. For example: A water pump asset can have a temperature time series that records a data point in units of Â°C every second.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * [Sequence](https://doc.cognitedata.com/api/0.5/#tag/Sequences) are similar to time series in that they are a key value pair, but rather than using a timestamp as the key, another measurment such as depth could be the key. For example, this is used in practice when drilling and taking measurments at various depths.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * A [3D](https://doc.cognitedata.com/api/0.5/#tag/3D) model is typically built up by a hierarchical structure. This looks very similar to how we organize our internal asset hierarchy. 3D models are visualized via Cognite's dashboards.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* It is important to refer back to the [SDK](https://cognite-sdk-python.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/cognite.html) for specific details on arguments on all avaiable methods on how to access these objects."
